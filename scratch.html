      <h2 class="h4">Why I Love Watch Collecting</h2>

      <p>
        My interest in watches started with a single everyday piece, then grew into a
        <strong>full-blown fascination with automatic and mechanical movements</strong>.<br>
        Each watch is a tiny machine on the wrist that tracks time, history, and design all at once.<br>
        I especially enjoy pieces with a clean dial and a <span style="background-color: yellow;">
        slightly quirky detail, like an unusual bezel or hand shape</span> that makes the watch feel unique.<br>
        And yes, I still check the time on my phone, but the watch makes it more fun.

             The story of the Omega Watch by Gary Walburger
 
The story begins when I was serving a mission in Australia. I was serving with a companion, Steve Malan. We were serving in Brisbane, Queensland. I noticed that he wore a very expensive watch – a Rolex Seamaster. We served well together and still keep in touch. I knew I would be travelling at the end of my mission. Through Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. An early stop was Hong Kong. While I was there, I decided to purchase a fine watch - an Omega Constellation (gold). It cost $200. It was  really nice, and I was very proud to have it. Along the way, we made 24 stops. It turns out that the cost of an airplane ticket for our extended trip was the same $600 as if I flew direct from Sydney to Los Angeles. My parents agreed to send American Express travelers’ cheques to several locations. Hong Kong was the first pickup stop. As a result, Hong Kong, allowed me to buy the watch. We enjoyed our trip to many exotic stops…Thailand  India, Egypt, Jerusalem, and  a number European stops. We found cheap hotels or hostels to sleep at night. When we arrived in London, I was down to five dollars, but was scheduled to have money at the Mission Home. There was a letter waiting for me. However, the letter read. ”Since you could afford to buy a very expensive watch you must not need money from us”. NO MONEY and only five dollars in my pocket. Because London was a major crossroad , they have a number of travelers claiming to be  missionaries. Elder Olsen, the Mission Secretary , quizzed me about missionary dialogue to assure him that I really was a missionary. He then went to talk to the Mission President. When he returned empty handed, he told me it was against mission policy to loan money to “missionaries”. He noticed my watch and asked if I would sell the watch for money to get home. My response was, “Can’t do that; this watch was special”. Then he said, “The Mission President (Marion D Hanks) is going to give you $50 from his own account to help you get home”. Obviously, I repaid him as soon as arrived home. I still have the watch 60 years later. It is still really special for me.
